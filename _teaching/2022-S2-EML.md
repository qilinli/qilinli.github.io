The unit will focus on special machine learning approaches, named explainable artificial intelligence or XAI, that generate solutions that can be trusted and are easy to understand and particularly well suited to fields such as medicine, finance, security, legal, military, and where human-machine interaction is needed. It will provide students with XAI fundamentals such as interpretability, explainability, and visualisation as well as legal and ethical issues surrounding XAI. The unit will also cover different classes of techniques from model-agnostic, example-based, to neural network interpretation. Finally, common XAI applications and current trends in XAI will also be discussed.
