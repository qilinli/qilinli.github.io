This unit introduces the mathematical theory that underlies the computing profession. It introduces proof and logic concepts central to computer science and programming methodology, including an introduction to set theory and mathematical relations, graph theory. Computational and mathematical recursion is also addressed, along with the paired concept of induction proofs. Finally, the analysis of software using discrete statistics is also addressed, including univariate statistics and confidence intervals.
