This unit introduces the foundational concepts, algorithms, and applications of Machine Learning (ML). Students will gain hands-on experience with diverse data types including tabular, image, text, and time series, and will learn to develop ML models such as linear models, SVM, decision trees, and neural networks. Covering a broad spectrum of topics within supervised and unsupervised learning, self-supervised learning, and deep learning, the unit also focuses on practical applications in computer vision and natural language processing, equipping students with the skills to implement ML solutions and solve real-world problems effectively.
